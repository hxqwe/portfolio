                       <p>The objective of this project was to create an app on MIT App Inventor based off of one of the tutorials provided by it. My partner and I started off with a Magic 8 Ball game tutorial, but couldn’t decide on what to do for it, so we changed it to the tutorial for Oh My Spikes, but found it hard to alter, which ended up with us making a game from scratch that was similar to pong. Our project went through a lot of phases and a lot of time was used up on testing out ideas with a lot of trial and error happening. The lack of time and the fact that our game kept changing was a setback, which made us work under pressure of the deadline being close. But in the end, our game turned out fine and we were able to finish it in time.</p>

                       <p>The objective of this project was to create a game or story using the program scratch. Inspired by google’s addictive game that appears when there is no internet connection, the T-Rex Game, my partner and I created a game in which the sprite controlled by the player, a circle, jumps over moving obstacles in the sprite’s path.The goal is to reach the score of 150 to end the game. Having a flowchart and other basic information helped us stay organized. The scenes were already planned out so all we had to do was code the sprite to do those actions. Working with one computer was a little hard to get used to at first, but turned out to be helpful because both partners had to communicate. The partner working on the computer, would frequently get stuck and ask the other for advice, ideas, and suggestions.</p>

                       <p>The objective of this project was to recreate the game, hangman, using the programming language, python. Since we had no plan prior to coding the game, we were forced to collaborate, unlike the other python projects, which we had plans for.</p>
