                        <p>I am striving to be a graphic designer. I believe this career acknowledges people's creativity, challenges them, and it is something I enjoy. I plan to achieve this by graduating from high school and taking the courses 2D design, the ROP classes, Visual Communications I and II, and if I can, AP studio art. I also intend to go to college for four years to get a bachelor’s degree.
                        <br><br>
                        When I’m not in school, my life mainly revolves around drawing. Other hobbies I have include reading novels and short stories, going on walks, listening to music, and doodling on my math homework. I also enjoy talking to my friends after finishing my work.
                        <br><br>
                        After coming to high school, I learnt that I enjoy working in pairs and groups and talking to people. I wasn’t as social, as I am now, when I was in middle school. Having so much partner and group work made me more open-minded and cooperative because we would have to come to agreements on what we would do. We also learned how to record what we did and plan ahead of our projects which made me organized. After trying out digital art I became more patient and perceptive because of how long it takes to color and be satisfied with your work.

                        I hope you enjoy viewing the rest of my portfolio. Thank you for your time!
